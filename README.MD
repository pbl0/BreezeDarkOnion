# Breeze Dark theme for OnionOS

Theme for the [OnionOS](https://github.com/jimgraygit/Onion) customization layer made for Miyoo Mini devices.

Heavily inspired by [Lilla by evolve](https://github.com/jimgraygit/Onion/files/8598951/Lilla.zip) theme and loosely following KDE Plasma's [Breeze Dark](https://develop.kde.org/hig/style/color/dark/) colorscheme and icons.

> **Important:** This is still a work in progess and I haven't replaced all purplish colors with the breeze blue.
